Things to discuss with Chris:

0. s apostrophy and apostrophy s are preserved. banana's or bananas'

1. Double quotation marks, single quotation marks, --> Use apostrophy to change to italics. CSS is em.

2. block quotes. Prefix each line with Right arrow and space. CSS is blockquote 

3. Back-tick for inline code, 

4. 3 x back-ticks (picket fence) for multi-line code. CSS is code

5. For bold use two apostrophy. Three apostrophy for bold italics.

6. CSS changes italics / em E.g. Colour, font, font-size 

7. CSS blockquote sets colour, font, ...

8. What to do with the quotation references. 
	* Change to super-script numeric and link it to a references / footer page
	* Hover over will show the reference.
	
9. Do you want "Chapter" in the Navigation Bar. Maybe just the Number. 1.x and 2.x, etc.
 
10. TOC to have all links 2.3, 2.3.1, 2.3.1.1, etc.

11. Each md file is one decimal. E.g. c2.1.en.md, c2.2.en.md. Possible there may be too much data in a file for smooth scrolling.

12. Change CSS to Green.

13. Hyphen conjuntive. Hyphen length. Seem to be using the short hyphen. Some spaces are missing. 
 
14. Add links throughout. e.g.  ...practice, as suggested in Section 2.5.2. <-- make a link? 

15. Make the italicized sub-headings as H4 i.e proceed with four hashes and set CSS for H4

16. Figure 2-4 overlay the ferns

17. 1.3.2 Sustainable Wellbeing <-- SW italicised???

18. change logo and favicon use .svg
 
Markdown with CSS 

# One hash is an H1 html heading
 
 
## Two hashes are an H2 heading
  

###Three hashes are an H3 heading
 
An *apostrophy either side of words* provides italics. HTML em
 
Two **apostrophies either side of words** provides bolding. HTML strong
 
Three ***apostrophies*** provides bolding and italics
 


This is `back-ticked` and it has now finished.

This is backticked python code `print("Hello World")` doing the hello world thing


```Text
This is a picket fence quote
It is multiline
It is suffixed with 'Text' so that it doesn't get colourised to a programming language syntax
It is CSS'ed by the 'code' tag
```

```Python
# Python code using a picket fence of 3 x back-ticks.
import sys
print("Hello World. Note hw the source code has syntax colouring.")
sys.exit()
```

Where is the second quote?

In New Zealand the advance of “child-centred orthodoxy led by the Ministry
of Education and parts of the “research” community (emphasis in the original), has been extraordinary
by international standards, controlling the official discourse about schooling over the last 30 years,
according to knowledge-based education advocate Briar Lipson (2020).
